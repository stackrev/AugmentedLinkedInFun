Ezt én ignorálom :);😠Negativitás az online térben - rossz hírek; vita: hogyan kezeljük?😠A saját felületeimen a rossz híreket; negatív történéseket csak annyira érintem; amennyire szükség van ahhoz; hogy a közönség megértse a pozitív üzenetet. Ha azt szeretném mondani; hogy olyan dolgokkal foglalkozz csak az életedben; amire hatással tudsz lenni; akkor hozzátenném; hogy az infláció; a háború nem ilyen. Abszolút ellene vagyok annak; hogy csak negatív dolgokról beszéljek; az ugyanis nem segít - ha azonban a negatív példa erősíti a mondandóm; akkor beleveszem. Az is fontos; mi milyen hatásokat engedünk be posztolóként - az online térben kapunk hideget is; meleget is.

Ennek a hasznos tudásnak egy részét szeretném most átadni az előadásom formájában a cégvezetőknek. Tudom; hogy a cégekben hasonló problémák fordulhatnak elő; mint amikkel én is szembesültem az elmúlt években - én ezekre kínálok olyan megoldási javaslatokat; amiket már kipróbáltam; és működnek; és ami a vezetést játékká teszik - szenvedés helyett.
